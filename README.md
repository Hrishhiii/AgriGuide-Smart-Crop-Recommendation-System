# AgriGuide-Smart-Crop-Recommendation-System

This Python program serves as a Crop Advisory Tool, designed to recommend suitable crops based on specific environmental conditions. It employs machine learning techniques such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression to predict crops based on factors like Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall. The script also includes functionalities for data visualization, clustering, and assessment of feature importance.

The project's primary objective is to aid farmers, agricultural experts, and agriculture enthusiasts in making informed decisions regarding crop selection. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, AgriGuide empowers users to optimize their crop yields, manage resources efficiently, and enhance agricultural productivity.
